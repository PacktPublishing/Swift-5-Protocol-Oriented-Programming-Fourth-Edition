**Increase productivity and build faster applications with Swift 5**

## What is this book about?
Protocol-oriented programming is an incredibly powerful concept at the heart of Swift's design. Swift's standard library was developed using POP techniques, generics, and first-class value semantics; therefore, it is important for every Swift developer to understand these core concepts and take advantage of them. The fourth edition of this book is improved and updated to the latest version of the Swift programming language.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Leverage the power of Protocol-Oriented Programming in your applications
* Leverage generics to create very flexible frameworks
* Learn how to implement common design patterns in a protocol-oriented way
